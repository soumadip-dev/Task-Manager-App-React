# TODO App

This project is a simple TODO app bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Starts the TODO app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode to test your TODO app.\
See [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the TODO app for production in the `build` folder.\
This bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready for deployment!

See [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This action is irreversible. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!**

You can `eject` at any time if you want full control over the build configuration. This removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all configurations directly into your project so you can customize them as needed.

You donâ€™t need to use `eject` unless you want advanced customization. The default configuration is suitable for most TODO app deployments.
